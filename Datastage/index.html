<p>The Center for Advanced Research through Online Learning facilitates research
using data from online courses. Stanford's instructional environments are instrumented
to collect a variety of data around participants' interaction with each other and
with course material. For example, we collect data on learners manipulating controls
on video players as they view portions of a class, solution submissions to problem
sets, posts on course message boards, peer grading activities, and some demographic
data. The type of data that is collected depends on the delivery platform used for
a particular class.</p>

<p>CAROL makes some of this data available for use by researchers and instructors,
both to improve instructional delivery and as the basis for more general insights into
teaching and learning in digital environments.</p>

<p>All data that CAROL shares is available on machine <i>datastage.stanford.edu</i>.
This page documents protocols for accessing learner data, describes technical details
about table schemas and other metadata useful for data analysis, and provides
practical guidance on using analysis tools with our system.</p>

<p>Data viewing programs for MAC and Windows allow you to
browse through our content. Going further, most analysis tools, like
R, SPSS, and Excel can connect directly to our databases. Similarly,
visualization tools are available that allow you to create static, or
interactive charts of data directly from our sources. We run a
<a href="http://www.tableausoftware.com/products/server">Tableau Server</a>
to which you can publish visualizations you create with the Tableau
Desktop visualization tool. Visitors can manipulate these
visualizations to the degree you provide for. A comment area is
available for each view to discuss the information. If desired, access
to the views can be limited.</p>

<h2 id="access">Protocols for accessing learner data</h2>

<p>Although we do not keep highly sensitive information on this
server, we do need to protect the data from malicious intrusion. If
you are interested in studying the data, please fill out
<a href="http://carol.stanford.edu/research">our request form</a>.</p>

<p>While the form accommodates requests for data with personally
identifiable information, we can only provide such access in special
cases. However, the data from which personalized information has been removed
is quite rich, so we anticipate that most users will not need access to
sensitive information.</p>

<p>If you are the instructor of a class, and you need the data to improve
future runs of your course, the personally identifiable data is more
freely available than if the data is used for research.</p>

<p>Note that all researchers must demonstrate completion of training in human
subjects research ethics prior to receiving learner data.</p>

<p>
If your results are published in a paper, we appreciate credit for the data,
as well as a note telling us about how you used the material. Both of these steps
help us justify the cost of data collection and provide us with more information
on the development of science using online learner data.

<h2 id="summary">Summary of Available Data</h2>

<p>Datastage holds learning research data derived from courses offered on
three platforms: NovoEd, Coursera, and Lagunita, a Stanford instance of the
OpenEdX platform.</p>

<p>Documentation on Coursera export formats are described in
<a href="https://spark-public.s3.amazonaws.com/mooc/data_exports.pdf">this document</a>.</p>

<p>No detailed documentation is available for NovoEd tables. Please contact us if you
plan to use NovoEd data; we are happy to advise on what is possible with the NovoEd
course data.</p>

<p>We have developed a local system for ingesting and structuring data from Stanford
courses taught using the OpenEdX platform. These data include raw events taken
directly from the course tracking logs and instructional data, as well as secondary
computations and other derived datasets. More detailed information on table schemas
can be found below.</p>

<p>Note that the tracking log data collected from the OpenEdX platform is known to
be incomplete. These logs are intended to list each interaction between the platform
and each learner as they progress through a course. For example, the tracking logs
capture video playback control interactions as well as assignment submissions. The
platform currently misses approximately 1% of these events. Users of data from
Coursera have reported similar issues. The EdX consortium is working on fixing this
issue; meanwhile, consider data based on tracking logs to be conservative estimates
of actual course behavior.</p>

<h3>Stored tables and associated views</h3>

<ul>
  <li><b>EventXtract</b>: A much slimmed view of the OpenEdX tracking log
    events. The view only includes fields that are currently in use by
    the platform. </li>

 <li> <b>ActivityGrade</b>: Assignment grades; includes right/wrong for each
   problem part, the learners' solution choice for each answer pard,
   and the first and last solution submission times. Constructed from platform table
   courseware_studentmodule.</li>

 <li> <b>VideoInteraction</b>: An excerpt from tracking logs, focusing on
   participants' interactions with video.</li>

 <li> <b>Performance</b>: Daily cumulative assignment performance per
   learner. This is the average grade over all assignments up to the
   day before the query. A view onto ActivityGrade.</li>

 <li> <b>Demographics</b>: Combines learner self-reported demographic
   information across multiple tables. Does not contain PII.</li>

 <li> <b>FinalGrade</b>: Final grade is an anonymized view onto the private table UserGrade (see below). FinalGrade
contains the learners' grades as computed by the platform at the end of the course. Unless instructors
change grading policies after the course ends, grades in this view reflect what learners take
home as the overall course grade. In contrast, grades in the Performance table are the average of a learner's grades received in all assignments submitted to date. This average for one learner is
the average of all ActivityGrade <i>percent_grade</i> numbers of that learner.</li>

 <li> <b>ABExperiment</b>: Data resulting from the use of the OpenEdX AB
   testing facilities.</li>

 <li> <b>OpenAssessment</b>: Data resulting from the use of the OpenEdX
   peer grading facilities.</li>

 <li> <b>UserCountry</b>: country of origin by IP address. Each row is a tuple
   consisting of one anonymous user id, the two-letter country code,
   the three-letter country code, and the spelled-out country. If a
   participant accesses the platform from different IP addresses,
   each IP address has its own row in the table. Multiple accesses
   from the same IP generate just one row.</li>

 <li> <b>EdxForum.contents</b>: Forum entries since about June
   2013. The entries are in relational form. Two versions can be
   generated: anonymized with hashed user ids
   different from the hashes used in other tables, and anonymized
   using the same hashes.</li>

 <li> <b>EdxQualtrics.question</b>: Survey questions administered
    via the Qualtrics service.</li>

 <li> <b>EdxQualtrics.choice</b>: Choices for multiple choice questions above.</li>

 <li> <b>EdxQualtrics.Response</b>: Learner responses to survey
   questions.</li>

 <li> <b>EdxQualtrics.ResponseMetadata</b>: Information about the
   learner behind each survey response. This table can be used to
   link survey responses to learners in the course.</li>

 <li> <b>CourseInfo</b>: Facts about courses, such as start/end dates,
   academic year and quarter in which a course was offered. </li>

 <li> <b>EdxProblem</b>: Metadata on problems offered to learners in courses.</li>

 <li> <b>EdxVideo</b>: Metadata on videos in courses.</li>

</ul>

<h3>Infrequently shared tables</h3>

<ul>

 <li><b>LoadInfo</b>: Information about archive updates.</li>

 <li> <b>UserGrade</b>: Raw grades as recorded by the platform. An
   amalgam of the platform tables auth_user and
   certificates_generatedcertificate. This table is not normally
   shared, as it includes personally identifiable
   information. However, the anonymized view onto UserGrade:
   FinalGrade (see above) is the table to use for anonymized grade and
   distinction information.</li>

 <li><b>EdxPrivate.EventIp</b>:IP addresses for each event. This table
     is only available by special arrangement.</li>

 <li><b>State, InputState, Answer, and CorrectMap</b>: These tables are
     subsumed by the above tables. If you are familiar with the OpenEdX
     tracking logs, you will recognize the names and can use these tables
     individually as needed.</li>

</ul>

<h3>Computed tables</h3>

<ul>
 <li> <b>Time-on-task</b>: Estimate for how long participants worked online on
   their courses. Computed from tracking log events, and partitioned
   into 30 minute sessions. Available: every session for every participant
   and course, weekly aggregates of the sessions, and course level
   aggregates. Session length for the computations can be customized
   on request, but this is a manual process. This table is computed on-demand
   and is not stored in our database.</li>

</ul>

<h3>Mirrored platform tables from OpenEdX</h3>

<p>In addition to the above tables, a number of <a href="#mirrors">tables
are mirrored</a> directly from the Stanford OpenEdX platform, with some delay.
This collection can be extended as needed.</p>


<br><hr>


<h2 id="search">Available data</h2>

<h3>Search all courses</h3>

<p>The archive includes data from the following Stanford courses:

<h2 id="appB">Explanation of OpenEdX data fields</h2>

<p>The Edx and EdxPrivate databases provide a lossless translation from
the OpenEdX platform tracking logs to relational tables. The
translation was constructed based on tracking logs of Stanford's
OpenEdX classes.</p>

<p>Each entry in a tracking log contains information about one small
interaction that one participant undertook with the learning
platform. Examples are the submission of a problem solution, a video
control action, like starting a video, or the initial creation of an
account. Note that the event handling and collection facilities in the OpenEdX
platform are not perfect yet. Events do get lost on the way. The EdX
consortium is working on this issue; in the meanwhile it is important to
consider computations based on track logs as lower bounds.</p>

<p><b>Beware 9c1185a5c5e9fc54612808977ee8f548b2258d31</b>: One event
track failure is that some screen names show up as empty strings. When
we anonymize these empty screen names, they all come to look like the
same anonymized person, the above ugly string. When we export tables
for you, we filter these duds out. But if you work on the database
tables themselves, you need to take of it yourself.</p>

<p>The logs were designed to hold every piece of information that might
need to be captured now or in the future. Not all of the log fields
are currently in use. Of the many columns in the relational tables
only some therefore need to be considered at this point. We therefore
created some tables that allow you to focus:</p>

<ul>
  <li>EventXtract</li>
  <li>VideoInteraction</li>
  <li>ActivityGrade</li>
</ul>

<p>We call these the <i>basic</i> tables.  During export, we partition the
tables into groups that correspond to the analysis purposes for which
they are intended. The <b>Basic Tables</b> are meant for everyday
use. Those tables exist in the database on Datastage, and we can
export extracts of the three tables for individual classes as well.</p>

<p>Export table group <b>Engagement</b> are tables that approximate how
much time course participants spent interacting with a course on their
computer. These tables are only available as per-course exports. They
do not exist in the database, but are computed when we export.  We
will add more table groups as we go along.</p>

<hr>
<h3 id="basicTables">Basic Export Tables</h3>

The first of the basic export tables is the main table, which contains
all the events: <i>EventXtract</i>. NOTE: the <i>event_type</i> field
is the key to interpreting the remaining columns. Please see the
<a href="http://edx.readthedocs.org/en/latest/">OpenEdX
Tracking Log documentation</a> of the original JSON formatted
fields. Those descriptions are authoritative.

If your focus is video behavior analysis, then the <b>VideoInteraction</b>
table is the easiest to use. It just extracts the video events from
the EventXtract table; the video related information is the same in
both tables.
</p><p>
Note that participants can download videos, and subsequently use their
own, local player. The platform software will not 'see' such local
activities, so this table can underestimate video activity frequency.

The <b>ActivityGrade</b> table holds events that concern homework
assignments. Each row in the table is one solution submission, or
inspection of one assignment by one participant. The rows inform whether
the solution was correct, in some parts, or in its entirety. If only
parts were correct, the table shows which parts, and which incorrect
answers the participant provided.
</p><p>

<b>Note 1:</b>For historical reasons the ActivityGrade table contains not only
grade related activities, but also some activities like accesses to surveys
or course chapters. You can filter out the true grade related items by
considering only rows in which num_attempts is not -1.
</p><p>

<b>Note 2:</b>the ActivityGrade table is not constructed from EdX track
event logs. Instead, this table is composited from information in
the platform table courseware_studentmodule. In particular the
infamous JSON encoded <i>state</i> field in that table is parsed and
its JSON values are made accessible as columns in ActivityGrade.

wise to use DISTINCT when querying:

The <b>EdxQualtrics</b> set of tables contains data from pre-course and
post-course surveys. Qualtrics maintains detailed documentation <a href="http://www.qualtrics.com/university/researchsuite/reporting/download-data/understanding-data-set/">here</a>;
the following information explains some idiosyncrasies that may make
analysis slightly easier. <span class="code">Survey</span>
and <span class="code">ResponseMetadata</span> below are views, rather
than tables. The <span class="code">response</span> is base tables. The
underlying survey data structures that we get from Qualtrics are
messy. The views/tables below are an attempt to pull out the most
important attributes from the tangle. We
add <a href="#surveyExamples">example</a> queries after the
table/view list.
<p>
The <span class="code">question</span> and <span class="code">choice</span> tables provide information about a survey as a
whole. The <span class="code">QuestionNumber</span> is used in
the <span class="code">response</span> table to identify which question is being
answered. If you are looking for the <span class="code">QuestionNumber</span> that
corresponds to a particular question, search on
the <span class="code">QuestionDescription</span> field. See <a href="#surveyExamples">example</a> below.

<b><span id="surveyExamples">Examples:</span></b><p>
<ul>
<li>
Get all Survey IDs, and (answer) Description
values for a survey question that matches:
'How likely is it that you would recommend an online course taught
by Stanford University faculty...':
<pre>
SELECT SurveyId, Description
  FROM (SELECT QuestionNumber
          FROM question
          WHERE MATCH(QuestionDescription) AGAINST ('recommend*faculty')) AS QuestionNumbers
       LEFT JOIN response
       ON response.QuestionNumber = QuestionNumbers.QuestionNumber;
</pre>
</li>
<li>
There is a special QuestionNumber value 'nps', which
stands for <a href="https://www.netpromoter.com/know/">Net
Promoter Score</a>. This is a standard question asked in marketing:
<p class='quote'>"How likely is it that you would recommend [brand] to a friend or
colleague?".</p>
We asked this question in many surveys, and the question
is marked as 'nps'.
<p>Count number of responses to the Net Promoter
Score question for each survey:
<pre>
SELECT SurveyId, COUNT(*) AS NumResponses
  FROM response
 WHERE QuestionNumber = 'nps'
 GROUP BY SurveyId;
</pre>
</li>
<li>
Given a survey id, get a histogram of its Net Promoter Question:
<pre>
SELECT Description, COUNT(*) AS Frequency
  FROM response
 WHERE QuestionNumber = 'nps'
   AND SurveyId = 'SV_aatmUGYOCSgpAk5'
 GROUP BY Description
 ORDER BY CAST(Description AS SIGNED INTEGER) ASC;
</pre>
</Li>

<li>

How many surveys asked
<p class='quote'>How many open online courses have you started before
  this one?</p>
Since QuestionDescription has a fulltext index, you can use regular
  expressions:
<pre>
SELECT COUNT(DISTINCT SurveyId)
  FROM question
  WHERE MATCH(QuestionDescription) AGAINST ('started*this one?');
</pre>
</li>
<li>
How many responses did each survey receive?
<pre>
SELECT SurveyId, COUNT(*) AS NumResponses FROM response GROUP BY SurveyId;
</pre>
</li>

</ul>

<p>
For users working with data from Coursera courses: it's possible to link survey
responses to Coursera data by joining the 'a' ID field with the session_user_id field
contained in the ID map from Coursera's data export. You need to know which Coursera
database corresponds to which SurveyID; this data can be looked up manually in the
Podio database. For example (replacing `COURSERA_DB_NAME` and `SURVEYID` with a matching
pair as designated in Podio.CourseIDMap):
</p>

<pre>
  SELECT *
  FROM EdxQualtrics.response_metadata as edxq
  INNER JOIN `COURSERA_DB_NAME`.hash_mapping as hm
	 ON edxq.a = hm.session_user_id
  WHERE edxq.SurveyID = 'SURVEYID';
</pre>

</p><p>
Note that for each survey (agnostic of platform) some of the 'a' field values will
occasionally fail to correspond with any platform identifier.

All <b>Forum post</b> entries are scrubbed of personally identifiable
information. The following are redacted: phone numbers, zip codes,
email addresses, and the poster's name. In each case the type of
redacted information can be determined by the redaction text. For
example, you will see &lt;emailRedac&gt;, or &lt;zipRedac&gt;. For
poster names you will see
&lt;nameRedac_anon_screen_name_redacted&gt;. These replacements keep
word count intact. Unfortunately, international zip codes are varied
enough that detecting them results in many false positives. Some
non-zip numeric information is therefore redacted for no good
reason. Conversely you may find some text that does identify someone
in the course directly or indirectly. We do the best we can at the
scale of information. Human inspection of a 30,000 post samples
revealed a scrubbing success rate of 98.4%. Please be respectful if
you do find one of the rare cases where identification is
possible. Keep the information to yourself,
and <a href="mailto://paepcke@cs.stanford.edu">report it to us</a> so
that we can fix the problem.
</p><p>
Here is a complication stemming from privacy protection: you will find
the anon_screen_name column filled with the single value
'anon_screen_name_redacted'. You can therefore not use this column to
select by participant as you do on all the other tables. Instead, when
selecting from the EdxForum.contents table, you need to use
column <i>forum_uid</i>.
</p><p>
This approach works fine while working within the Forum table
only. But the setup prevents you from relating Forum posts to other
tables to find correlations between Forum postings and, say, grade
outcomes.
</p><p>
The reason for this separation is a known attack onto the privacy in
the non-Forum tables when the same participant code is used in both
worlds. We call the fully redacted Forum table <i>non-relatable</i>.
</p><p>
To explore correlations you need a translation from
the <i>forum_uid</i> in the Forum table to the <i>anon_screen_name</i>
used in all other tables. To receive that translation,
please <a href="http://CAROL.stanford.edu/research">fill out the
application form</a> that you filled out before to gain access to the
data. This time, please make very clear in the free-form text field
that you already have access to the data, and that you just need the
additional Forum translation information.
</p><p>
Forum posts contain a number of identifiers. Here is an explanation of
relationships between these identifies. This explanation is based on
observation, not on documentation from the original software; the
information may therefore be incorrect or incomplete:
<ul>

<li><b>forum_post_id:</b> identifies the post in a given row. This is
   usually a question, but could be a comment.</li>
<li><b>comment_thread_id:</b> matches the original
   <i>forum_post_id</i> that started the thread in which
   the current post is a comment or reply.</li>
<li><b>parent_id:</b> identifies the immediate predecessor of the
   row's post in the thread of which the post is a part.</li>
<li><b>parent_ids:</b> provides a full chain from the
   thread-originating post to the current comment/reply.</li>
</ul>

</p><p>
Each Forum post is contained in one row:
</p><p>
<div align="center">

        border-collapse: collapse;

<h3  id="engageDetail">Engagement Export Tables</h3>

Engagement data for one class consists of three tables. One lists all
dates, times, and durations of each session by every participants in
the class. The second lists the weekly number of minutes each
participant spent on the course. The third shows a summary of how many
minutes participants spent in the aggregate on the course, the total
number of work sessions, and three counts: the number of times that
participants' weekly median session length was between 1 and 20
minutes, the number of times participants' weekly median session
length was 21 minutes to 1hr, and the number of times their weekly
median session length was greater than one hour.
</p><p>
For example, say a course with 3 learners lasts for two weeks.  The
first week two learners had an observed median session length of 15
minutes. One learner's median was 2hrs. The second week of the course
one learner's median was 25 minutes, and the other two learners
engaged for a median of 13 minutes.
</p><p>
The Median1-20 would be (2 + 2 = 4), the Median21-1hr would be 1, and
the Median>1hr would be 1.
</p><p>
Notice that the median statistically dampens the impact of
outliers. For example, say one learner has all course materials
available from an earlier course offering. The eager participant runs
through the entire course during the first week, staying up through
long sessions all through the night. For the remaining weeks the
learner rests. What is the effect on the weekly session length? The
answer depends on what the other learners were doing. If no learner
touched the course during the first week, the median will be dominated
by the eager learner, and the number of weeks during which the median
was greater than one hour will be incremented.
</p><p>
If instead many learners are active during the first week, but they
all only put in very short sessions, then the median will favor those
short sessions, and instead of incrementing the number of weeks in
which the median was greater than one hour, the number of weeks in
which the median was in the short session category will be incremented
instead. Thus, the week counts by median communicate a <i>typical</i>
level of engagement. If your research goal calls for a more fine
grained analysis, the first of the three tables is for you. As
explained, that table lists all sessions.
</p><p>
The first table in this group is usually large, because it lists
each <i>session</i> of each participant in a class. A session is
defined as a series of actions a participant undertook on the computer
while interacting with the course such that:
<ol>
  <li>The actions were detectable by the platform software, i.e. the
      actions triggered a logging event.</li>
  <li>No two actions were more than 30 minutes apart.</li>
</ol>
</p><center><img src="figs/engagementSessionExplanation.png" width="20%"></center></p>
When more than 30 minutes elapse between two events, the second event
is considered part of a subsequent session. Since the last event's
duration is not delimited by a follow-on action in the same session,
the last event is special. One might apportion no time to that last
event. Another option is to apportion the median inter-event time
lapse (which is 500sec). To be conservative we have settled on
apportioning 1sec to the last event. This decision implies that
the engagement computation underestimates the true result.
</p><p>
Note that this accounting of time engagement is quite approximate even
disregarding the decision about the last event's duration. For
example, participants might read course related materials for an hour
without generating a platform event. No event: no accounting for that
time. A similar short change occurs when participants work on a
paper-and-pencil assignment.

A typical row in engagement_weeklyEffort looks like this:
<center><img src="figs/engagement_weeklyEffort.png"/></center>

</p><p>
The final table in the engagement group is a single row for each
course. The row summarizes the efforts across all weeks in one
course. If a single course is being exported, then the table will
contain only one line.
</p><p>
This table provides an overview of session lengths that learners tended to
invest in a course. For example, if the number of weeks in which the median
session length exceeded one hour is high, then learners had to invest
long, contiguous studying times throughout most of the course. In contrast,
if the number of weeks in which the median session length was 1-20min
is high, then the course tended to have students frequently engage
for short periods of time.
</p><p>
As an extreme, consider a learner who works through an entire course
in the first week, then sits out the remaining time. (This example
would require all course materials to be available from the start.)
This learner would possibly increment the greater-than-one-hour week
count by one. Whether or not that increment occurs depends on the
behavior of other learners during that same week. If everyone else
only spent 1 minute during that week, the median would be 1-20min for
that week, and the corresponding 1-20min count would be incremented
instead of the greater-than-one-hour count.
</p><p>
This summary measure is therefore not sensitive to extreme
behaviors by individual learners. Such learners do not unduly distort
the result. Note, however, that the summary measure does not
tell us <i>when</i> in a course long sessions prevailed.

<h3 id="functions">Useful MySQL Functions</h3>

If you query the database directly, the following stored functions and procedures
might prove useful. Some of the functions are privileged because they perform
user id conversions that would put privacy in peril. Those functions
can only be used with the prefix <i>EdxPrivate</i>. You'll know that
you hit on one of these if you try to use a function, and MySQL
complains that the function does not exist. The current set of
private functions are tagged with an asterisk in the table below.
<br>
Note that there is a difference between MySQL functions, and MySQL procedures.
A function is invoked as if it were a built-in function, like MIN(), or COUNT().
Examples:
<pre>
SELECT wordcount('I love data');
SELECT * FROM EventXtract WHERE anon_screen_name = idInt2Anon(44000);
</pre>
However, note that due to MySQL not being smart sometimes, the second
SELECT above is much slower than the following idiom:
<pre>
SELECT idInt2Anon(44000) INTO @theAnon;
SELECT * FROM EventXtract WHERE anon_screen_name = @theAnon;
</pre>
In contrast to functions, a procedure must be called in a separate
statement, and a return variable must be provided. The idiom is:
<pre>
CALL computeEnrollmentCoursera('antimicrobial-001', @theEnrollment);
SELECT @theEnrollment;
</pre>
</p><p>
A word about the functions that begin with 'id', such as idAnon2Ext().
These are functions that convert between a number of learner IDs that
are used (i) in Datastage's tables, (2) in tables created by the EdX
platform, and (3) as learner IDs given to outside learning tool
vendors.
</p><p>
Instead of personally identifiable learner names, Datastage uses in
its tables a 20-byte hash, which is always in column
anon_screen_name. This ID shows up as the <i>Anon</i> in the above
conversion function name.
</p><p>
Meanwhile, the OpenEdX platform code uses a different integer ID for
each learner. We call those IDs a learner's <i>Int</i> id. You will
see functions with embedded <i>Int</i>, such as idAnon2Int().
</p><p>
A third source of IDs for any given learner are 16-byte hashes that
OpenEdX produces in line with the Learning Technology Interchange
(LTI) method of generating IDs. OpenEdX assigns each learner a
different LTI ID for each course they enroll in. Also assigned to each
learner is one distinguished LTI ID that is independent from any
course: the learner's <i>Global LTI ID</i>.  For historic reasons, we
call a learner's LTI IDs their <i>External</i> IDs. You will see
function names that include the letters <i>Ext</i>, which stands for
external (e.g. idAnon2Ext())
