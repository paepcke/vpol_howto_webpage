<h1>The Stanford MOOCPosts Data Set</h1>
<h1 id="byline">Created by nine ODesk Consultants<br>
under direction of<br>
<a href="mailto:akshayka@stanford.edu">Akshay Agrawal</a> and <a href="mailto:paepcke@cs.stanford.edu">Andreas Paepcke</a>
</h1>

The Stanford MOOCPosts dataset contains 29,604 anonymized learner
forum posts from eleven Stanford University public online classes. The
purpose of this collection is to serve as a foundation for testing
computational algorithms that process forum posts. You are free to use
the corpus for academic studies. Please credit the corpus in any
publications for which it proved useful.

<h2 id="corpus">The Corpus</h2>
Each post was manually coded along six dimensions by three
independent coders:
<ul>
<li>Is this post a question? (Yes/No)</li>
<li>Is this post an answer? (Yes/No)</li>
<li>Is this post an opinion? (Yes/No)</li>
<li>What sentiment does this post express? (1-7)</li>
<li>How much confusion does this post express? (1-7)</li>
<li>How urgent is it that this post be seen by an instructor? (1-7)</li>
</ul>

In addition, coders were asked to flag posts in which our automated
anonymization program had failed, and that therefore revealed any
poster's identity. These posts were then manually
anonymized. Intercoder reliability was computed, and separate 'gold'
codings were derived for each of the dimensions. This procedure is
described <a href="#procedures">below</a>.
<p>
The posts are organized into three sets of related courses:

<h2 id="procedures">Procedures</h2>

Creating the final set involved several steps. First, the randomly
chosen posts were anonymized via an automated facility. Then the
30,000 posts were distributed to ODesk consultants for coding. The
returned sets were then combined into one gold set. These steps are
next described in more detail. 

<h3 id="anonymization">Anonymization</h3>

The original forum posts were on the Web, visible to tens of thousands
of learners who had enrolled in the respective course. Anyone,
anywhere was free to enroll without cost, and thereby enjoyed access
to the material. We nevertheless removed personally identifiable
information from this research set as best we could. Here a
description of our procedure.
<p>
Automated anonymization replaced identity-revealing words with a
single word that indicates the type of revealing information being
obscured. Example: when the anonymization algorithm detects a string
that might be a telephone number, the string is replaced
with <i>&lt;phoneRedac&gt;</i>. Some such fillers contain underscores, all are
delimited by angle brackets. Except for rare cases of a full,
two-part name being redacted, word count of the posts is thus the
same as the original, as long as the tokenizer underneath the word
counter considers the terms in angle brackets as one token. Strings
that are suspected to be zip codes are replaced by <i>&lt;zipRedac&gt;</i>, email
addresses are replaced by <i>&lt;emailRedac&gt;</i>. For uninteresting reasons,
posters’ names are replaced by the more complex
<i>&lt;nameRedac_&lt;anon_screen_name_redacted&gt;&gt;</i>.
<p>
The coders were asked to note any posts that still contained
personally identifying information. A staff member went through all
those posts, and manually redacted as per the above automated
procedure.

We ask that you respect the posters' anonymity, and do not attempt to
reconstruct redacted information.

<h3 id="coding">Coding Process</h3>

Each course set was coded by three distinct, independent, paid
coders. That is three triplets of coders each worked on one set of
10,000 posts. No coder worked on more than one course set. Each coder
attempted to code every post for his or her particular set. All posts
with malformed or missing scores in at least one coder’s spreadsheet
were discarded. This elision accounts for the difference between the
29,604 posts in the final set, and the original 30,002 posts.

<h3 id="setgen">Generating the Gold Sets</h3>

We employed the following heuristics in computing scores for the gold
sets: For each course set and <b>Likert variable</b> in that course
set, we computed the
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Krippendorff%27s_alpha">Krippendorff
alphas</a> for all possible combinations of coders. In every case, we
found that some combination of two coders achieved higher agreement
than the combination of all three coders. For each variable we
therefore picked the coder combination that achieved the highest
agreement and discarded the scores from the coder not included in that
combination. A given post’s gold score was computed as an unweighted
average of the two scores assigned to it by the selected coder
combination. You can download CSV files containing scores submitted by
the
<a href="likert-coder-combinations">
optimal coder combination for each Likert variable, across all three
course sets</a>. Each row in these files correspond to one row in the
gold set. The two columns in each file list the scores given by the
two most similar coders. The gold set contains the average of those
number pairs. For example, file education-pair-confusion.csv lists for
each post the confusion scores given by the coders with the highest
Krippendorff alpha around the confusion dimension. Note: you can use
these files to compute your own inter-coder reliability score between
the two coders.
<p>
For each course set's <b>binary variable</b>, post gold scores were
chosen by majority vote across all three coders.  Download CSV files
with <a href="binary-scores-pre-vote"> scores submitted by all three
coders for every binary variable, across all course sets</a>, and
the <a href="binary-scores-pre-vote/consensus"> consensus
files</a>. Note: you can use these files to compute your own
inter-coder reliability score between the three coders with respect to
each binary quantity.
<p>
The <a href="Krippendorff.xlsx"> spreadsheet titled
Krippendorff</a> enumerates the Krippendorff alphas for the CSVs of
Likert and binary variables. Note that the spreadsheet contains two
worksheets. Alphas were computed using <code>ReCal</code>, a free
online tool. Likert variables were treated as interval data, while
binary variables were treated as nominal.

<h3 id="coderinstructions">Coder Instructions</h3>
The <a href="CoderInstructions.pdf">coder instructions</a> were posted
on <a href="https://www.odesk.com/">oDesk</a>. We hired nine
colleagues for the task. During the first week of coding some
questions arose, which we answered immediately. The most important
clarification was that it was possible for a post to have multiple
binary dimensions be true. That is, a post could express both a
question, and an opinion.

<h2 id="appendix1">Appendix: Corpus Learner Origins</h2>

The following tables show course countries of learner origins for
countries that contributed more than 100 learners to a respective
course. Courses without a table below only hosted learners in
which no country contributed more than 100 learners.
